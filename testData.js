After incubation the unbound conjugate is washed off. Next, avidin conjugated to Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) is added to each microplate well and incubated. The amount of bound HRP conjugate is reverse proportional to the concentration of Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) in the sample. After addition of the substrate solution, the intensity of color developed is reverse proportional to the concentration of Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) in the sample.","Alternative Names":"PAF-Acether; AGEPC; Acetyl-Glyceryl-Ether-Phosphorylcholine","Item Name":"Platelet Activating Factor","Research Area":"Metabolic pathway;Infection immunity;Cardiovascular biology;","Datasheet":"http://www.cloud-clone.com/manual/ELISA-Kit-for-Platelet-Activating-Factor-(PAF)-CEA526Ge.pdf","Image":"http://static.cloud-clone.com/product/od/CEA526Ge.jpg","provider":"5d8c9255d817cf0a4c00b5e9","isPharmaceutique":false,"__v":1,"category":"Elisa"}]
