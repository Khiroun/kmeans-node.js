Standards or samples are then added to the appropriate microtiter plate wells with a Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody. After TMB substrate solution is added, those wells that contain Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) will exhibit a change in color. The enzyme-substrate reaction is terminated by the addition of sulphuric acid solution and the color change is measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450nm Â± 10nm. The concentration of Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) in the samples is then determined by comparing the O.D. of the samples to the standard curve.","Alternative Names":"Apo-A1; ApoA-1 Milano; ProapoA-I; Proapolipoprotein A-I; Truncated apolipoprotein A-I","Item Name":"Apolipoprotein A1","Research Area":"Metabolic pathway;Cardiovascular biology;Hepatology;","Datasheet":"http://www.cloud-clone.com/manual/ELISA-Kit-for-Apolipoprotein-A1-(APOA1)-CEA519Rb.pdf","Image":"http://static.cloud-clone.com/product/od/CEA519Rb.jpg","provider":"5d8c9255d817cf0a4c00b5e9","isPharmaceutique":false,"__v":1,"category":"Elisa"},{"providers":[],"_id":"5d8cc34d0b052e1dbce44c13","variants":["{\"Size\":\"48 Tests\",\"price\":594.367}","{\"Size\":\"96 Tests\",\"price\":784.81}","{\"Size\":\"5 x 96 Tests\",\"price\":3006.645}","{\"Size\":\"10 x 96 Tests\",\"price\":5545.885}"],"Cat":"338-CEA526Ge","nom":"General Platelet Activating Factor PAF Elisa Kit","Buy Price":306.46,"Detection range":"37.0-3000pg/mL","Organism species":"Pan-species (General)","Sensitivity":"< 14.4pg/mL","Sample type":"serum, plasma and other biological fluids","Assay length":"2h","Assay type":"Competitive Inhibition","Application":"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Antigen Detection.","Specificity":"<p>\r\n    This assay has high sensitivity and excellent specificity for detection of Platelet Activating Factor (PAF).<br/>\r\n    No significant cross-reactivity or interference between Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) and analogues was observed.\r\n</p>","Precision":"<p>\r\n    Intra-assay Precision (Precision within an assay): 3 samples with low, middle and high level Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) were tested 20 times on one plate, respectively. <br/>\r\n    Inter-assay Precision (Precision between assays): 3 samples with low, middle and high level Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) were tested on 3 different plates, 8 replicates in each plate. <br/>\r\n    CV(%) = SD/meanX100 <br/>\r\n    Intra-Assay: CV<10% <br/>\r\n    Inter-Assay: CV<12% <br/>\r\n</p>","Stability":"<p>\r\n    The stability of kit is determined by the loss rate of activity.
